# Live-js
Icecat Live is a (free) service that enables you to insert real-time product content from some hundreds of major brands or manufacturers in any of your application.  This code handles the content intake from Icecat backend servers and embeds into your application, providing the render functionality.
Feel free to modify it and use as a part of your solution, if you like to propose improvements over the code that will be highly appreciated.
 
If you will have questions please don't hesitate and email our support - [support@icecat.biz]
